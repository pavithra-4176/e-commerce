What is React?
React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, especially for web applications. It was developed by Facebook and is now widely used by developers around the world.
Think of React as a tool that helps you build interactive websites—like dashboards, forms, or social media apps—where the content updates dynamically without reloading the whole page.

🧠 Core Concepts of React
1. Components
React apps are made up of components.
🔹 A component is like a small piece of your UI (e.g., a button, a form, a navbar).
🔹 You can reuse components across your app.
